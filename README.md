# ReduxApp1

This project is basically a learn and do one.

Each branch represents an implementation of ngrx with varying complexities.

Please refer this file in each branch to know its implementation.

#Implementation

Now, here we will implement ngrx with the followin gfeatures:-

store
actions
reducers
effects

+

StoreModule.forFeature(...) -- This will bring in almost all of the features of ngRx in our program.



Why almost ?
Because, there is one more thing to add - ngrx/Entity. That we will do in a searate branch.
